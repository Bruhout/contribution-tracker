## Contribution tracker
This program keeps track of the payments to be made by each member in a **contribution based buying plan**.

#### Contribution buying
A group of people come together to pay equal amounts of money in order to purchase something. However, each member has a MAX AMOUNT they will pay. Suppose 5 people wish to buy an object worth $2000.
1. Each may contribute $400 and purchase the thing.
2. Or one of them might only be willing to pay $200. Now everyone else has to pay $500. This one person is a **Passive member**

A passive member is willing to pay for the product but the individual contribution is too high for him to afford. If there were 10 members, individual contribution would reach $200, and he would become an **Active member**.

This is the purpose of the program. It keeps track of how much each person must pay based on the numbers of members and how much each of them are willing to pay.
